      <h2>Resume</h2>
        <p>I recently graduated from a Web Development course at General Assembly
        where I increased my typing speed from 10 words per minute on my type
        writer to 100 words per minute on my new MacBook Pro. They also taught
        me how to be an awesome Web Developer. During my spare time, I enjoy
        senior water aerobics, pickling, and sending time with my great
        grand children.</p>
